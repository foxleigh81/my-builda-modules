# My Builda modules

I am the developer of the [Builda](https://builda.app) NPM app. This is a collection 
of modules that I use in my personal projects.

Feel free to use these modules in your projects, but **fair warning**; I may modify
them without notice. If you need them to be stable, please fork the repository,
or go find their equivalent in the [Builda](https://builda.app) trade store.


> **Note**: The trade store is not yet available. So all of the below is nonsense. :)

## Modules

### Scaffolds

--- | --- | ---
`page` | [ArcticFox](https://builda.app/m/narnia-on-ice) | A simple NextJS page scaffold built in TypeScript. It also has a storybook story and uses scss modules. Please note, that the Trade Store counterpart does not use the same template name, that is a variable in the template.
`component` | [RedFox](https://builda.app/m/fennec) | A simple React component scaffold built in TypeScript. It also has a storybook story and uses scss modules. 

### Prefabs
